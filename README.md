## About
OneTime: Is a stupid implementation of a time based OTP (One Time Password) Generator using smsbox.gr API, written in java. DO NOT USE this thing for real life applications because it's unsecure. I also included a php example!

## Example
An example PHP OTP auth page is included that checks whether your OTP is valid or not. Just make a HTTP request like this: http://example.com/index.php?otp=<YOUROTP> Note: In order to work both pages should use the same "private" key
